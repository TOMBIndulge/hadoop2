## Sample Tools

These sample tools are provided as references for building custom spatial tools.

To try out a point in polgon aggregation using hive using global earthquake data and california county polygons, try the [point-in-polygon-aggregation-hive](https://github.com/Esri/gis-tools-for-hadoop/tree/master/samples/point-in-polygon-aggregation-hive) sample. 

To try out a point in polgon aggregation using a custom map reduce job using global earthquake data and california county polygons, try the [point-in-polygon-aggregation-mr](https://github.com/Esri/gis-tools-for-hadoop/tree/master/samples/point-in-polygon-aggregation-mr) sample. 

To complete the sample Map Reduce algortihm used in the [Vehicle Trip Discovery Blog post](http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2013/08/09/vehicle-trip-discovery-with-gis-tools-for-hadoop/), use the [trip-discovery](https://github.com/Esri/gis-tools-for-hadoop/tree/master/samples/trip-discovery) sample.
