### Running the GP Model sample

#### Setting up the model for ArcGIS Geoprocessing


1. Download and set up the [Geoprocessing Tools from Hadoop](https://github.com/Esri/geoprocessing-tools-for-hadoop)
2. Create a directory to put the GP model and sample data in, such as `C:\esri-gp-sample`
3. Clone or download the source of this repository
4. Extract `gis-tools-for-hadoop/samples/data/samples.gdb.zip` to your local sample directory
5. Copy the files from `gis-tools-for-hadoop/samples/data/point-in-polygon-aggregation-mr/gp` to the same directory
6. Now open ArcCatalog or ArcMap and connect to the sample directory
7. At this point, you should be able to open the model `RunSampleApplication` in the `SampleModel` toolbox
