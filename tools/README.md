# Spatial Tools for Hadoop - Samples

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

* Access to a Hadoop cluster, or a local distribution of Hadoop
* A Git client that can pull from a GitHub repository
* A Unix environment is **highly** recommended. 
* For the Hive sample, you will need a distribution of Hive 0.10 or greater


### Setting up the samples

First, Pull the latest version of the samples from GitHub.  An easy way to do this is to clone the base *hadoop-tools* repository if you haven't already done so.

For the purposes of this tutorial, we're going to make a directory in your home directory and use that as the base for the samples.
```bash
mkdir ~/esri-git
cd ~/esri-git
git clone git@github.com:Esri/hadoop-tools.git
```

You should be able to navigate to `sample-workflows`

```bash
cd ~/esri-git/hadoop-tools/sample-workflows/
```
