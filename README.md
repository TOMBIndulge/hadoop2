gis-tools-for-hadoop
====================

The GIS Tools for Hadoop are a collection of GIS tools that leverage the [Spatial Framework for Hadoop](https://github.com/Esri/spatial-framework-for-hadoop)
for spatial analysis of big data.  The tools make use of 
the [Geoprocessing Tools for Hadoop](https://github.com/Esri/geoprocessing-tools-for-hadoop) toolbox,
to provide access to the Hadoop system from the ArcGIS Geoprocessing environment. 

## Features

* Sample tools that demonstrate full stack implementations of all the resources provided to solve GIS problems using Hadoop
* Templates for building custom tools that solve specific problems


![GIS Tools Breakdown](http://esri.github.com/gis-tools-for-hadoop/images/gis-tools-breakdown.png)

**Resources for building custom tools**
* [Spatial Framework for Hadoop](https://github.com/Esri/spatial-framework-for-hadoop) 
 * Java helper utilities for Hadoop developers
 * Hive spatial user-definied functions 
* [Esri Geometry API Java](https://github.com/Esri/geometry-api-java) - Java geometry library for spatial data processing 
* [Geoprocessing Tools](https://github.com/Esri/geoprocessing-tools-for-hadoop) - ArcGIS Geoprocessing tools for Hadoop


## Instructions

Start out by navigating to [samples](https://github.com/Esri/gis-tools-for-hadoop/tree/master/samples) and following the instructions provided with each sample.  Once you are comfortable with the whole setup, check out the templates and see if they can be tailored to fit your big data GIS needs.

## Requirements

Requirements will differ depending on the needs of each tool or template. At a minimum, you will need:

* Access to an [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org) cluster
* [ArcGIS for Desktop](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgis-for-desktop) or [Server](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgisserver) for geoprocessing and visualization

Other requirements may include:

* [Apache Hive](http://hive.apache.org/) in order to run Hive queries
* [Apache Oozie Workflow Scheduler](http://oozie.apache.org/) for workflow scheduling

Additional requirements will be spelled out by tools or templates.
