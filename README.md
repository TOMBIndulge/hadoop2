====================

The Hadoop Spatial Tools are a collection of ArcGIS tools to leverage the Spatial Framework for Hadoop for spatial analysis of big data.  The tools make use of the [GP Tools for Hadoop](https://github.com/Esri/gp-tools-hadoop) toolbox, and the [Spatial Framework for Hadoop](https://github.com/Esri/spatial-framework-hadoop) to integrate with a Hadoop cluster.
