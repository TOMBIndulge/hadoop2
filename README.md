spatial-tools-hadoop
====================

The Spatial Applications for Hadoop are a collection of spatial applications that leverage the [Spatial Framework for Hadoop](https://github.com/Esri/spatial-framework-hadoop)
for spatial analysis of big data.  The tools make use of 
the [GP Tools for Hadoop](https://github.com/Esri/gp-tools-hadoop) toolbox,
to provide access to the Hadoop system from the ArcGIS Geoprocessing environment. 

## Features

* Customized applications for solving specific types of problems that build on the Java libraries and GP tools provided below
