spatial-tools-hadoop
====================

The GIS Tools for Hadoop are a collection of GIS tools that leverage the [Spatial Framework for Hadoop](https://github.com/Esri/spatial-framework-hadoop)
for spatial analysis of big data.  The tools make use of 
the [Geoprocessing Tools for Hadoop](https://github.com/Esri/gp-tools-hadoop) toolbox,
to provide access to the Hadoop system from the ArcGIS Geoprocessing environment. 

## Features

* Sample tools that demonstrate full stack implementations of all the resources provided to solve GIS problems using Hadoop
* Templates for building custom tools that solve specific problems
*
