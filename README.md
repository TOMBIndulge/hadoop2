hadoop-spatial-tools
====================

The Hadoop Spatial Tools are a collection of ArcGIS tools to leverage the Hadoop-Spatial-Framework for spatial analysis of big data.  The tools make use of the [Hadoop-GP-Tools](https://github.com/Esri/hadoop-gp-tools) toolbox, and the [Hadoop-Spatial-Framework](https://github.com/Esri/hadoop-spatial-framework) to integrate with a Hadoop cluster.
